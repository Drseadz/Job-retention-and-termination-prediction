# Job-retention-and-termination-prediction
This notebook will focus on the dataset of employees within an organization and investigate the employment termination as well as predict future terminations and retention from the organization. Varables within the dataset will be used in this analysis. This notebook will go through making 3 machine learning models to predict employment termination based on knowledge of employees within the organization.

The notebook would show the organization's heterogeneity, and also forecast the likelihood that an employee's contract would be terminated. The following research questions are needed to accomplish these goals:

What is the diversity profile of the organization?

What are the trends of employment losses in the organization?

How can we predict the job termination and retention of employees?
